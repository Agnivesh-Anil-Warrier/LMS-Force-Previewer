# No Force Download - an LMS Force Previewer (Chromium Extension)

Some Learning Management Systems (LMS) force PDF files to download instead of allowing browser preview.

This Chrome/Chromium extension automatically modifies LMS links by setting:

`forcedownload=0`

so PDFs open directly in the browser preview instead of downloading every time.
